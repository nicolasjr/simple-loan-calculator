# Simple Loan Calculator

A Loan Calculator that allows users to know what will be the monthly installment and interest for a given amount and term.

## Setup

Setting up this repository to get going is extremely simple.

Assuming you already have installed Node and npm (if you don't, [check how to here](https://nodejs.org/en/)), all you'll need to do is:

* Open the terminal in the root folder of the project

* Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

* Once all the dependencies are installed, just run, from the root folder:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

Now you should be seeing the app running in your browser. :)
